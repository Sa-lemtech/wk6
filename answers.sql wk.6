-- Question 1: INNER JOIN
-- Retrieves employee details and their associated office code.
-- INNER JOIN ensures that only employees who have a matching office code in the 'offices' table are included.
SELECT
    e.firstName,
    e.lastName,
    e.email,
    e.officeCode
FROM
    employees AS e
INNER JOIN
    offices AS o ON e.officeCode = o.officeCode;


-- Question 2: LEFT JOIN
-- Retrieves product details, ensuring ALL products from the 'products' table are included,
-- even if they do not have a corresponding entry in the 'productlines' table (productLine will be NULL).
SELECT
    p.productName,
    p.productVendor,
    p.productLine
FROM
    products AS p
LEFT JOIN
    productlines AS pl ON p.productLine = pl.productLine;


-- Question 3: RIGHT JOIN
-- Retrieves order details and customer number.
-- A RIGHT JOIN ensures that ALL orders from the 'orders' table are included (the right table),
-- even if there is no matching customer in the 'customers' table.
-- Note: In most SQL dialects, you can achieve the same result more intuitively with a LEFT JOIN by swapping the table order (orders LEFT JOIN customers).
SELECT
    o.orderDate,
    o.shippedDate,
    o.status,
    o.customerNumber
FROM
    customers AS c
RIGHT JOIN
    orders AS o ON c.customerNumber = o.customerNumber
LIMIT 10;
-- The 'LIMIT 10' clause restricts the result set to the first 10 orders retrieved.
